# Coding
I'm learning Python and that's the first time I use pygame.
I took a repo from a pygame tutorial by youtuber TechwithTim (https://github.com/techwithtim/Python-Checkers) and made my own game from it.

# Gymkhana
"Gymkhana" is the French name for "Connections", a board game I used to play when I was younger.
